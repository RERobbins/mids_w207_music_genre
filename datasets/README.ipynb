    " - `acousticbrainz_json` contains sample acousticbrainz features in `json` format. All acousticbrainz features can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yxwbgq4LXrTfNImyr3cM7nK5AprjR6Hf?usp=sharing)\n",
    " - `melspecs_npy` contains sample mel-spectrograms in `npy` format. All mel-spectrograms can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12GxtZGke_7-M0piXF_NMvxNZnvi6qMnR?usp=sharing)\n",

    "The aggregated and flattened dataset can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16DJpJiOIrEGKtOy-fE95jiaZIMZCxHmf/view?usp=sharing). This dataset is in a `.pickle.bz2` format, which can be imported into a DataFrame using `pd.read_pickle()` function from the `pandas` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prefixed columns are ordered in the following manner:\n",
    " - Metadata (e.g. `album_id`, `artist_id`, `duration`)\n",
    " - Audio properties (e.g. `bitrate`, `codec`, `lossless`)\n",
    " - Tags (e.g. `album`, `albumartist`)\n",
    " - Genre (e.g. `rock`, `pop`, `classical`)\n",
    " - Version (e.g. `essentia`, `git_version`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining columns are features provided by AcousticBrainz. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the column `rhythm_beats_position` is not flattened because the dimension of the arrays are different across tracks. The values in this column are kept as 1d arrays.\n",
